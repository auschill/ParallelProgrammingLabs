# Lab8_State_Machines

## Lab Overview

This lab aims to implement a state machine that acts as a lock. The requirements of this
The lab consists of understanding the design requirements for implementing the Verilog design.

## Background

State machines are very useful tools in any computer system. They make it easy to visualize and solve
all kinds of problems. A state machine is a device that keeps track of the `state` of something. That `state` can change due to changes to input values or through some pre-determined sequence. A common example
might be a traffic signal at an intersection. The `state` describes how the lights at the intersection may be lit at a given
time. The status will change regularly after fixed time intervals for simple timed lights. The same lights could be made
more intelligent by incorporating sensor inputs that detect whether cars are waiting, causing the state to change
differently. That might be from a radar detector or magnetic coil in the road. Additional lights could incorporate a
pedestrian crossing, so a pedestrian crosswalk request button could be another input.

Every state machine must have some initial state to ensure everything begins properly and a reset signal to return
to that initialization. There are two main categories of state machines, ```Moore``` and ```Mealy```. A Moore machine is a state machine whose output values are determined only by its current state. A ```Mealy``` machine is defined as a state
machine whose output values are determined by its current state and current inputs.

## Part I(Design Requirements)

You must design a ```Moore``` state machine that controls a digital lock. Your lock
should have three inputs: a reset, a submit (clock) bit, and a decimal digit (4-bit) input. The decimal digit input will encode the
decimal digits 0-9 in the standard unsigned binary encoding. You will input 3-digit codes by setting the decimal
digit input to a number and activating the submit bit three times in a row. To unlock your device, it should
receive three correct digits. In addition, there will be three `Tamper Freeze` sequences, which will freeze the device until a
reset signal is received. You can use these sequences:

`Correct` sequence: “642”

`Tamper Freeze` sequence: “641”; “652”; “643”

Your digital lock will have three outputs: a Locked bit, a Ready bit, and a Tamper bit. The Locked bit and Ready bits should initially be on. After you input your first digit, the Ready bit should turn off. If the correct input sequence is observed, the Locked bit should turn off and remain off until the lock is reset. No further inputs should affect the
device. If one of the Tamper Freeze sequences is observed, the Tamper bit should be turned on and remain on until the reset is activated. No further inputs should affect the device. If any other input is observed, the device should return to the ready state by activating the Ready bit and waiting to accept the next 3-digit input.

You can also understand the process by the table below:

Considering that the button press is at a high level, it is necessary to debounce the button to ensure the stability of the data.

### Implementation

The part can reference the [Generate Bitstream](https://uri-nextlab.github.io/ParallelProgrammingLabs/docs/Labs/Lab1_led.html) in lab1.

The block design is shown below:

<div align=center><img src="lab8images/block_diagram.PNG" alt="drawing" width="800"/></div>

Here, we use the ```AXI_GPIO``` IP, write the number to the ```dint``` as input and read the value of the LEDs as the display.

### Download the bitstream file to PYNQ

We need to download the design_1_wrapper.bit to the local machine. Go to Lab8/project_1/project_1.runs/impl_1, download design_1_wrapper.bit, and upload the file to the PYNQ. And we also need to upload the design_1.hwh  file which is in the Lab8/project_1/project_1.gen/sources_1/bd/design_1/hw_handoff.

```python
    from pynq import Overlay
    from pynq import Bitstream
    bit = Bitstream("design_1.bit")
    bit.download()
    bit.bitfile_name

```

When download the file on the board, you will see:

```python
# Import the MMIO class from the PYNQ library. MMIO allows for memory-mapped I/O operations 
# from Python, enabling interaction with hardware registers on FPGA.
from pynq import MMIO

# Define the base address and range for the GPIO block designated for writing operations.
# This is typically set in the hardware design and must match that configuration.
GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS = 0X41200000  # Base address for the GPIO used for writing
GPIO_RANGE = 0x1000             # Address range covered by this GPIO

# Initialize an MMIO instance for writing, allowing the Python code to interact
# with the GPIO hardware mapped at the specified base address.
gpio_write = MMIO(GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS, GPIO_RANGE)

# Define the base address for the GPIO block designated for reading operations.
# This should also match the configuration specified in the hardware design.
GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS_r = 0X41210000  # Base address for the GPIO used for reading

# Note: This should likely be `GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS_r` based on context.
# Initialize an MMIO instance for reading.
gpio_read = MMIO(GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS_r, GPIO_RANGE)  # Should be GPIO_BASE_ADDRESS_r for the reading block

def seven_segment(number):

    # on a digit-by-digit basis
    digits = [representations[digit] for digit in str(number)]
    # Now digits is a list of 5-tuples, each representing a digit in the given number
    # We'll print the first lines of each digit, the second lines of each digit, etc.
    for i in range(5):
        print("  ".join(segment[i] for segment in digits))

```

```python
# Define the offset within the GPIO space where data will be written. Often, '0x0' is the offset for the output data register.
DATA_OFFSET = 0X0  # Offset for the data register in the GPIO space

# Define the data value to be written to the GPIO. For example, '0x6' could represent a specific pattern of bits to turn on LEDs.
DATA = 0X6  # Data to be written to the GPIO register

# Write the data to the GPIO device. This operation changes the state of GPIO pins configured as outputs.
gpio_write.write(DATA_OFFSET, DATA)  # Write the data to the register at the specified offset


```

The blue LED is on, showing it's locked.

And then you need to press the ```submit ``` button like below:

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/3.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/></div>

 When entering the first data, the ```ready``` LED is off.

```python
# Read the current state from the GPIO device. This involves accessing the memory-mapped I/O region
state=gpio_read.read(0x0)
seven_segment(state)

```

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/3.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/></div>

```python
DATA = 0X4

gpio_write.write(DATA_OFFSET,DATA)

```
When writing `4` to the input, see the board below:

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/4.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/></div>

Then, you need to press the ```submit ``` button.

```python
# Read the current state from the GPIO device. This involves accessing the memory-mapped I/O region
state=gpio_read.read(0x0)
seven_segment(state)

```
<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/4.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/></div>

```python

DATA = 0X2

gpio_write.write(DATA_OFFSET,DATA)
```

And then you need to press the ```submit ``` button like below:

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v2/6.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/></div>

It's unlocked, and the blue LED is off because we input the right code number

```python
# Read the current state from the GPIO device. This involves accessing the memory-mapped I/O region
state=gpio_read.read(0x0)
seven_segment(state)

```
